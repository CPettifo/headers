                        <h3>Concept & Planning</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            The project began when I identified some skills that I was lacking and became the conduit for me learning the basics of these tools, namely:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Docker & Docker Compose for Containerisation & Orchestration</li>
                                <li>Communication between microservices</li>
                                <li>GitHub for version control & developing in different environments</li>
                                <li>Integrating API calls</li>
                                <li>SSH and development & maintenance in a linux environment</li>
                            </ul>
                            I looked for free APIs and found VPNApi and wanted to demonstrate how much information is contained or can be gleaned from our request headers. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            First I dusted off my Raspberry Pi and configured it for SSH access and installed Docker and Git for development, then I created a Cloudflare tunnel
                            to allow for access to the app from the public internet. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>(Re) Learning Docker</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            I wanted to show that I understood Docker, so I broke the processing down into two separate components, the first containing the front-end which would
                            pass the request header to the back-end, which would make the API call, then process and return this information.                    
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Collector</h3>

                        <h3>Bringing It Together</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Finally, the frontend presents the data in a clean, educational format. Users can see their own headers, fingerprint uniqueness, and a step-by-step 
                            breakdown of how tracking occurs. Interactive elements allow testing different browsers, enabling or disabling VPNs, and experimenting with privacy 
                            settings to understand the effect on identifiability.                         
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Rambling Awakens (writing)</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Throughout development, I maintained a running commentary on discoveries, insights, and reflections about privacy, fingerprinting, and cross-device tracking. 
                            This evolved into a section for storytelling and context, bridging technical explanations with real-world examples (like Gregâ€™s shopping scenario).                     
                        </p>

                            <h3>Your Request Headers Tell a Story #TODO: Move rambling to bottom of page </h3>
                            <p class="lead">
                                A good amount of information is given away in a request header, including details like your browser, operating system,
                                language settings, IP address, and other metadata. This information is <em>normally</em> used to optimise functionality and 
                                user experience (for example serving region or language-specific content), but it can also reveal personal data about you.
                                Your headers can be used to link your browsing habits to you <b>even if you block trackers, reject cookies, and use a VPN!</b>
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                There are identifying characteristics, i.e. when you visit a site if you are "unique" enough, that site will say, hey someone 
                                using Chrome visited my site, they spoke English and were in the Beijing timezone, but their location was set to Dublin
                                , they were on Mac and were using Chrome. This information is shared among some places and a site like say, Youtube, Google, 
                                Amazon might link this to your login, which tells them, oh Greg logged in using this browser at this time, and that browser matches
                                one that visited Toys-R-Us yesterday. 
                                Then that information can be sold to data brokers, so that an online browsing history is built about you, without your consent! 
               
                            </p>

                            <h3>What Your Header Story is Used For</h3>
                            <p class="lead">
                                Your journey across the internet is used primarily to serve you more personalised advertisements. If linked to your personal identity, it
                                <em>enriches</em> the information that data brokers collect on you. I'll use an example of Greg, who normally browses
                                using Chrome, where he stays logged in to his social media accounts. Greg is savvy enough to know that if he is shopping for his partner's 
                                surprise present - a stuffed panda - he might start seeing personalised ads for stuffed animals. If his partner glances at his screen, the 
                                surprise could be ruined. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                To avoid this, Greg decides to use Firefox to purchase the gift. However, when he goes back to Chrome, he finds that he starts to see advertisements
                                for stuffed animals. How could he have been tracked across different browsers?
                            </p>

                                Greg could have signed in to his Amazon account to make the purchase, <a href="https://joindeleteme.com/blog/does-amazon-sell-your-personal-information/">
                                Amazon would've known that Greg was interested in stuffed pandas</a>, when he returned to Chrome his Amazon suggestions would include similar items. 
                                
                                <b>Greg used another Amazon account that he only makes gift purchases on, so this was not the cause</b>

                                What started as a small portfolio project led to some surface-level research into the world of browsing data and how this information is 
                                harvested to be sold to data brokers, and how much information is out there about all users of the internet.

                                Unfortunately dealing with fingerprinting is counter-intuitive, steps that you take to try to maintain your privacy like using a VPN, or a less popular browser like Brave,
                                LibreWolf, or even Firefox, make you stand out against the majority of users using Chrome. Heck, if I browse on Firefox on my Ubuntu computer my fingerprint is <em>unique</em>
                                out of over 300,000 other browsers.
